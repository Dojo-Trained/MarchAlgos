______________________________ALGO #1________________________________________________

This Algo is designed to test your ability to extend the functionality of built-in ruby classes. 
In this case, we want you to extend the built-in Array class 
with the following methods: square(), cube(), average(), sum(), even() and odd().

Explanation:

square() must return a copy of the array, containing all values squared, the original array must not be changed
cube() must return a copy of the array, containing all values cubed, the original array must not be changed
average() must return the average of all array values, average() on an empty array must return NaN
sum() must return the sum of all array values
even() must return an array of all even numbers, the original array must not be changed
odd() must return an array of all odd numbers, the original array must not be changed
Examples:

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
numbers.square(); // must return [1, 4, 9, 16, 25]
numbers.cube(); // must return [1, 8, 27, 64, 125]
numbers.average(); // must return 3
numbers.sum(); // must return 15
numbers.even(); // must return [2, 4]
numbers.odd(); // must return [1, 3, 5]

Description
A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of symbols or elements, whose meaning may be interpreted the same way in either forward or reverse direction. Famous examples include "Amore, Roma", "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" and "No 'x' in 'Nixon'". - wikipedia

Our goal is to determine whether or not a given string is a valid palindrome or not.

Like the above examples, here are a few test cases which are also populated:

"Amore, Roma" => valid
"A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" => valid
"No 'x' in 'Nixon'" => valid
"Abba Zabba, you're my only friend" => invalid
You can see that they are case insensitive and disregards non alphanumeric characters. In addition to a few predefined tests, your function will also be tested against a random string generator 50 times which are guaranteed to produce valid palindromes.

NOTE: reverse/reverse! have been disabled for String/Array and reverse() for JS.

Description
You need to write regex that will validate a password to make sure it meets the following criteria:

At least six characters long
contains a lowercase letter
contains an uppercase letter
contains a number
Valid passwords will only be alphanumeric characters.
